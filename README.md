# EC2 Instance Creation with Terraform

This repository contains Terraform code to create and manage an EC2 instance in AWS. The following steps guide you through setting up the EC2 instance using Terraform.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, ensure you have the following:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) installed.
- An AWS account with access to create EC2 instances.
- AWS CLI configured with proper credentials (`aws configure`).

## Steps to Create EC2 Instance

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lutfar1996/ec2-iac.git
cd ec2-iac
```

### Key Formatting Enhancements:

1. **Headers (`#`)**: Used headers to define sections like the introduction, prerequisites, steps, etc.
2. **Code Blocks (```)**: Enclosed the commands in code blocks to maintain proper formatting.
3. **Lists**: Used bullet points for lists such as prerequisites, steps, etc.
4. \*\*Inline Code (`)`: Highlighted inline commands like `terraform apply` using backticks.

### After Updating:

- Save the file as `README.md`.
- Commit and push the changes:

  ```bash
  git add README.md
  git commit -m "Fix formatting for README"
